# Managing your CIS deployment for optimal reliability

To achieve optimal reliability for your IBM Cloud CIS deployment, you can use our Page Rules to be sure that your web content wil be delivered to your customers, even if your origin server or the cache has a problem.

Here are the best Page Rule settings to give your site maximum reliability:

 * Always Online
 * Origin Cache Control
 * Forwarding URL
 
 ## Always Online
 
  * placeholder
 
 ## Origin Cache Control
 
   * placeholder
 
 ## Forwarding URL
 
To ensure that your content is always available (HA), you can set up a forwarding URL to be used in case your site is unavailable. 
 
 **Note:** When you enable a **Forwarding URL**, all of your other settings are disabled becuase you are sending all your traffic to another URL.
