# WAF Custom Rules

Custom WAF Rules, found in the left navigation bar under `Security > Web Application Firewall > Custom rules`. WAF Rules are available on Enterprise plans and are created based on that customer's unique requirements and/or their website's traffic patterns. This means that you can ask us to block virtually any combination of characteristics of a request. 

This is to cater for situations where the attacker may be using a specific pattern or user agent and the IBM WAF doesnâ€™t have a rule in place already, that may be targeted specifically for your website's structure and not other customers. In these situations, you can create a custom rule for your web property.

## Request a Custom Rule

To request a rule, email wafsup@us.ibm.com with rule requirements or traffic patterns. 

Provide as much information as possible, including:
- Access logs showing a sample of about 100 alleged malicious requests.
- If the requests have a POST body, we need a sample POST request including the POST data, to determine whether the request contains anything we can block or trigger on.
- Tell us whether you would like the requests to be outright blocked, or to be challenged in case of potential false positives.
- Specify the domains to which you want these rules applied.
Whether you want the rules turned on or off by default.

*Note*: After your custom WAF rules are created, you must enable all custom rules for them to take effect.
