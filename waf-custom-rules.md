# WAF Custom Rules

Navigate to Custom WAF Rules through **Security > Web Application Firewall > Custom rules**. WAF Rules are available on Enterprise plans and are created based on that customer's unique requirements and/or their website's traffic patterns. This means that you can ask us to block virtually any combination of characteristics of a request. 

Custom WAF Rules cater to situations where the IBM WAF doesnâ€™t have a rule in place already, and the attacker uses a specific pattern or user agent that is targeted specifically for your website's structure. In these situations, you can create a custom rule for your web property.

## Request a Custom Rule

To request a rule, email wafsup@us.ibm.com with rule requirements or traffic patterns. 

Provide as much information as possible, including:
* Access logs showing a sample of about 100 alleged malicious requests.
* A sample POST request including the POST data (if the requests have a POST body) to determine whether the request contains anything we can block or trigger on.
* Whether you want the requests to be outright blocked, or to be challenged, in case of potential false positives.
* The specific domains to which you want these rules applied.
* Whether you want the rules turned on or off by default.

**Note**: After your custom WAF rules are created, you must enable all custom rules for them to take effect.
