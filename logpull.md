# Enterprise Log share

# Log Pull

IBM customers can access the Log Pull service on Enterprise accounts. This service allows users to consume request logs over HTTP using a RESTful API.
This API provides a method for customers to access a domainâ€™s request logs using an IAM token.

These logs contain data related to the connecting client, the request path through the network, and the response from the origin web server.


## Examples:
1. **Based on Ray Id**

Request

```
curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: Token1234" https://api.cis.cloud.ibm.com/v1/logpull/<URL-encoded-CRN>/zones/<zone-id>/logs/rayids/<ray-id>
```

Response

 ```
    {
    "ClientIP": "68.278.11.89",
    "ClientRequestHost": "testing.logpull.com",
    "ClientRequestMethod": "GET",
    "ClientRequestURI": "/var/www",
    "EdgeEndTimestamp": 1545155129703000000,
    "EdgeResponseBytes": 1935,
    "EdgeResponseStatus": 403,
    "EdgeStartTimestamp": 1545155129696000000,
    "RayID": "48b371889c489b2c"
}
```

2. **Based on time duration**

Required Parameters: 

Start and End time in UTC ISO-8601 date representation with a time duration of a minute or an hour.

Request:
```
curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: Token1234" https://api.cis.cloud.ibm.com/v1/logpull/<URL-encoded-CRN>/zones/<zone-id>/logs/received?start=2018-12-17T17:27:00Z&end=2018-12-17T17:28:00Z
```
Response:

3. **Fields**

If "fields" are not specified in the request, a limited set of default fields will be returned. The full list of all available fields can be found here:

Request

```
curl -X GET -H "X-Auth-Token: Token1234" https://api.cis.cloud.ibm.com/v1/logpull/<URL-encoded-CRN>/zones/<zone-id>/logs/received/fields
```

Fields are passed to the request as a comma separated list. So, to have "ZoneID" and "RayID", use:

```
fields=ZoneId,RayID
```
