# How IBM Cloud Internet Services keeps your work secure

IBM CIS is a globally distributed cloud service that blocks threats and limits abusive bots and crawlers, which can waste your bandwidth and server resources. CIS works as a global HTTP(S) reverse proxy and a managed DNS service provider. Your web traffic is routed through our intelligent global network to optimize both your performance and your security.

Here’s a quick feature overview:

## Security features

 * IP Reputation database
 * Web Application Firewall (WAF)
 * Complete access control (IP, country, ASN)
 * Unlimited DDoS mitigation

## Security Standards and platform

 * SSL (SHA2 and SHA1)
 * IPv6
 * HTTP/2 and SPDY

## DNS

 * Global any cast network
 * DNSSEC

## Network attacks and mitigation

Generally, we see attacks that fall into two categories

| Layer 3 or Layer 4 attacks | Layer 7 attacks |
|------------------------------|-----------------|
|These attacks consist of a flood of traffic at ISO Layer 3 (the network layer), such as ICMP floods) or at Layer 4 (the transport layer), such as TCP SYN floods or reflected UDP floods) |These are attacks that send malicious ISO Layer 7 requests (the application layer), such as GET floods.  |
| Automatically blocked at our edge | We handle these with “Defense Mode,” IP firewalls, WAF, Security level settings, and Rate Limiting |

**Summary**

 * Defense Mode tests browser features that many malicious clients lack
 * IP firewall actions take effect by IP or range (block, challenge, CAPTCHA, whitelist)
 * The WAF blocks or challenges known request patterns that are likely to be malicious
 * Rate limiting blocks requests that exceed a threshold set for an IP address
