# Getting Started

You can start routing traffic through Cloud Internet Services (CIS) with just a few steps. Start by adding the domain you want to manage. CIS scans the existing DNS records. Review the records and then configure your DNS provider with the provided nameservers.

**Step 1. Add Domain:**

Begin protecting and improving the performance of your web service by entering your domain. Our system then begins gathering your domain records. This process could take a few minutes.

**Step 2. Review Domain Records:**

Now that your domain records have been gathered, verify they are correct. You may also upload a DNS File, if you have one. When you are ready, click **Continue** to go to the next step.

**Step 3.Configure Your Registrar or DNS Provider:** 

To begin receiving the benefits of CIS, you must configure your domain name provider to use the name servers listed. For more detailed instructions, see **LINK TO EVENTUAL CONFIGURING DNS TOPIC**. 

After you've configured your registrar or DNS provider, it may take up to 24 hours for the changes to take effect. In the meantime, you can go to the Overview page to begin managing additional CIS functionality.
