# Global Load Balancer quick setup
You can directly create pools and health checks from the **Create Load Balancer** menu option. Navigate to **Reliability > Global Load Balancer > Create load balancer > Add pool**, and select the option to **Create New** under Origin pool.

Input a pool name, origins, and select a health check. You can create a new health check here by choosing **Create New** in the Health Check dropdown menu, and entering the information to create the health check. 

For fully configurable options, use the longer setup method in [Set up and configure your load balancers](glb-setup.html).

For definitions of common terms, see this [Glossary](glossary.html).
