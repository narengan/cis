# DDoS Protection

## What is DDoS?
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. In a DDoS attack, multiple compromised computer systems attack a target such as a server, website, or other network resource, and which affects users of the targeted resource.

The flood of incoming messages, connection requests, or malformed packets to the target system forces it to slow down or even crash and shut down, thereby denying service to legitimate users or systems. DDoS attacks have been carried out by diverse threat actors, ranging from individual criminal hackers to organized crime rings and government agencies.
