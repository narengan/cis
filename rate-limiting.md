# Rate Limiting

Rate Limiting (Enterprise plan only) protects against denial-of-service attacks, brute-force login attempts, and other types of abusive behavior targeting the application layer.

Select the type of rate limiting rule, either a **Custom rule** or **Protect login**

## Create a Custom rate limiting rule

Enter a rule name that helps you remember what the rule does. This is an optional field.

**Traffic matching criteria** uses the AND operation. Enter a URL that you are rate limiting, and then when requests from the **Same IP exceeds** your specified number of **Requests per second**, the rule specified is triggered.

The **Advanced Criteria** option allows you to specify which HTTP methods, header responses, and origin response codes to futher restrict the matching criteria. 

Select a value form the **Method** dropdown (ANY is the default).  

Update **HTTP response header**.  You can also **Add response header** to include headers returned by your origin web server. 

**NOTE:** If you have more than one header under **HTTP response header**, an _AND_ boolean logic applies.  To exclude a header from being matched, use the _Not Equal_ option. Also, each header must be an exact match. However, case sensitivity doesn't apply.

Under **Origin response code**, type the valid numerical value of each HTTP response code to match.  To include 2 or more response codes, separate each value with a comma. For example, you can enter `401, 403` if you only want those two error codes to count. 

### Configure response
Select from the actions listed, and specify the timeout period. In this case, the timeout refers to the ban period that the action takes place. A 60 second timeout means the action is applied for 60 seconds.

|Action| Description|
|------|------------|
|Block | Issues a 429 error when the threshold is exceeded|
|Challenge | User must pass a Google reCaptcha Challenge before proceeding. If successful, we accept the request. Otherwise, the request gets blocked.| 	
|JS Challenge |	User must pass a Javascript Challenge before proceeding. If successful, we accept the request. Otherwise, the request gets blocked.
|Simulate| You can use this option to test your rule before applying any of the other options in your live environment.

**Advanced response**

Specify the response type when a rule's threshold is exceeded. 

### Bypass
Bypass lets you create the equivalent of a whitelist or exception for a set of URLs.  No actions trigger for those URLs, even if the Rate Limiting rule is matched.

## Protect login
Protect login creates a standard rule that protects login pages against brute force attacks. Clients attempting to log in more than 5 times in 5 minutes will be blocked for 15 minutes. 

Enter a name for the rule, and the login URL.
