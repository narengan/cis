# Web Application Firewall (WAF)

IBM CIS provides Web Application Firewall (WAF), which examines web traffic looking for suspicious activity. It can automatically filter out illegitimate traffic based on rule sets that you apply to look at both GET and POST-based web requests. You can use various rule sets to determine what traffic to block, challenge, or let pass. WAF can block comment spam, cross-site scripting attacks, and SQL injections.

You can enable or disable WAF at your discretion. We recommend that you always leave it on.
