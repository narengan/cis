# Multi-domain support

IBM CIS supports multiple domains with the Enterprise Package and Enterprise Usage plans. 

To add an additional domain to your CIS instance, go to the **Overview** page. Under the **Domain** section, select the plus icon to the right of your domain. This reveals a section to connect an additional domain. Follow the steps in the section to complete adding a new domain: 

  * Connect domain
  * Setup DNS records
  * Delegate domain management
  
After adding a new domain, use the dropdown menu under the **Domain** section to switch between your domains. The **Domain** section is located on the **Overview** page and at the top of every page.
