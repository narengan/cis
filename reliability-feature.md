# How IBM CIS keeps your work reliable

IBM CIS improves your web services/applications reliability by avoiding downtime caused by unreliable hosting providers or internet and server outages. With Global Load Balancing you can deploy your web services/applications in multiple regions. IBM CIS routes your customer requests to the closest regions available when Global Load Balancing is enabled. If any region fails, the requests will be routed to the next closest location, thereby your customers will not be impacted by downtime.  You can sleep well at night knowing we are keeping your website or API running. IBM CIS will automatically send you notifications when your website or API fails and when it is restored.

(NOTE to Susan and Leslie: I will have a PR to add the graphic to the images directory. This image is modified from slide 3 in this ppt: https://ibm.ent.box.com/file/192242184545. It would be preferred if the orange computers are in IBM blue.)

Hereâ€™s a quick feature overview:

## Reliability features
