# Known Limitations

 * We recommend using Chrome.
 
 * The Free Trial plan is limited to one instance per account. After you create a resource instance and add a domain to it, you are not allowed to add new resource instances for CIS. This restriction is enforced even if you delete a trial domain and then attempt to add a domain again to the same resource instance. You'll encounter an error if you attempt to do so.

 * For this service, we support subdomain delegation only using NS records from another provider. CNAME delegation is not supported.
  
 * Wildcard A, AAAA, and CNAME records (*) cannot be proxied.

 * When you delete a dedicated certificate, it may reappear in the list for a short time before the deletion is complete.
 
 * To modify your custom dedicated certificateâ€™s hostnames after ordering, you must order a new certificate and then delete the old one. 
 
 * IP Rules created with two letter country codes can only be made with the 'Challenge' action.

## Global Load Balancer
 * Cloud Internet Services allows you to use the character `_` in load balancer hostnames, however, Kubernetes clusters cannot use `_`. 

 * The Standard plan permits a maximum of 5 load balancers, pools, and health checks. Each pool can have a total of 6 origins, but only 6 unique origins are permitted throughout each CIS instance.

* Health check events for deleted pools and origins cannot be filtered, but they still appear in the table.

* If you filter Health check events by `Pool Health`, `Degraded` pools are included because they technically are healthy, but may contain 1 or more critical origins.

* When adding the request header name for a health check, use `Host`. Using lower-case `host` for a health check fails.

## Web Application Firewall
 * For groups that are disabled by default, changing the mode or enablement of an individual rule in that group might result in an error. To work around this issue you can enable and disable the group prior to modifying the rules.
