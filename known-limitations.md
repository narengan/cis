# Known Limitations

 * We recommend using Chrome.

 * Editing the URL match for a page rule causes that rule to be placed at the lowest priority.
 
 * Without a configured domain, you can navigate to **Reliability > Global Load Balancers** to create your load balancer pools and health checks. However, if you select **Create load balancer**, configure the load balancer, and click **Provision 1 Resource**, the request will be rejected because a domain is required. This functional limitation helps the user understand the purpose of pools and monitors in the load balancer creation flow.
 
 * The Early Access program is limited to one instance per account. After you create a resource instance and add a domain to it, you are not allowed to add new resource instances for CIS. This restriction is enforced even if you delete a trial domain and then attempt to add a domain again to the same resource instance. You'll encounter an error if you attempt to do so.

 * When you add a new domain, our system currently does not gather or import your existing domain records.

 * For this Early Access program, we support subdomain delegation only using NS records from another provider. CNAME delegation is not supported.
 
 * At this time, LOC records cannot be imported. As a workaround, use the UI or API to create any LOC records.
 
 * Wildcard A, AAAA, and CNAME records (*) cannot be proxied.

 * When you delete a dedicated certificate, the certificate will temporarily be pending deletion. This may cause the certificate to reappear in the list for a short time before the deletion is complete.
 
  * To modify your custom dedicated certificateâ€™s hostnames after ordering you must order a new certificate then delete the old one.
