# FAQ

## What is TLS?
TLS is a standard security protocol for establishing encrypted links between a web server and a browser in an online communication. Aa TLS certificate is necessary to create a TLS connection with a website, and comprises of the domain name, the name of the company, and additional data such as company address, city, state, and country. It also shows the expiration date of the TLS certificate, and details of the issuing Certificate Authority (CA).

## How Does TLS Work?
Whenever a browser initiates a connection with a TLS secured website, it first retrieves the site's TLS Certificate to check if it's still valid. It verifies that the CA is one that the browser trusts, and that the certificate is being used by the website for which it has been issued. If any of these checks fail, you'll get a warning indicating that the website is not secured by a valid TLS certificate.

When a TLS certificate is installed on a web server, it enables a secure connection between the web server and the browser that connects to it. The website's URL is prefixed with "https" instead of "http" and a padlock is shown on the address bar. If the website uses an extended validation (EV) certificate, the browser may also show a green address bar.

## Why do I see a privacy warning?
The TLS certificates issued by IBM Cloud CIS cover the root domain (example.com) and one level of subdomain (*.example.com). If you’re trying to reach a second-level subdomain (*.*.example.com) you will see a privacy warning in your browser, because these host names are not added to the SAN.

Also, please allow up to 15 minutes for one of our partner Certificates Authorities (CAs) to issue a new certificate. You’ll see a privacy warning in your browser if your new certificate has not yet been issued.

## What is DDoS?
A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. In a DDoS attack, multiple compromised computer systems attack a target such as a server, website, or other network resource, and which affects users of the targeted resource.

The flood of incoming messages, connection requests, or malformed packets to the target system forces it to slow down or even crash and shut down, thereby denying service to legitimate users or systems. DDoS attacks have been carried out by diverse threat actors, ranging from individual criminal hackers to organized crime rings and government agencies.

## What do I do if I’m under a DDoS attack?

**Step 1:** Turn on “Defense mode" [Here's how](needs a link).

**Step 2:** Set your DNS records for maximum security.

**Step 3:** Do not rate-limit or throttle requests from IBM CIS, we need the bandwidth to assist you with your situation.

**Step 4:** Block specific countries and visitors if necessary.

## I got a 522 error, what do I do now?

A 522 error indicates we weren't able to establish a connetion with your origin server (ie, your host). After about 15 seconds of failing to connect, we close the connection and display a 522 error page.

This issue is usually caused by firewall or security software that accidentally blocks our IP addresses. Because CIS acts as a reverse proxy, connections to your site will appear to come from a range of CIS IPs. This behaviour can sometimes cause certain firewalls to block these connections, which prevents us from serving content to your site visitors properly.

To fix this issue, ask your host to whitelist all of the CIS IP ranges, which are listed [here](http://www.cloudflare.com/ips).

All of these IPs must be whitelisted to avoid 522 errors. It's also worth checking to see if any IPs in these ranges are blocked.

522 errors can also be caused by network connectivity issues, so confirm that your server and network is generally healthy and not overloaded.

If after taking the above steps you still receive errors, please contact IBM CIS support and confirm the following:

* You've whitelisted our IP ranges
* Your server/network is online and generally healthy

Please also provide a ray ID from a recent 522 error. We can use this to determine which CIS Datacenter you were hitting and run further tests.

## What is a proxied record and why do I need them?

Proxied records are records that proxy their traffic through IBM CIS. Only proxied records receive CIS benefits, such as IP masking, where a CIS IP is substituted for your origin IP to protect it:

```
$ whois 104.28.22.57 | grep OrgName
OrgName:        IBM
```

If you would rather bypass CIS on a domain (we will still resolve DNS), then non-proxying the record would be a possible solution.

## I got a DNS Validation error: 1004; now what can I do?

In order for page rules to work, DNS needs to resolve for your zone. As a result, you must have a proxied DNS record for your zone.
