# Administrating your IBM CIS

IBM CIS provides many ways to properly administer your brand presence, your account security, and your support process. We recommend working through each of our administrative best practices to ensure your customers and content are best served by the CIS network.

**Recommendations:**

* Manage your brand by customizing CIS pages
* Enforce 2-Factor Authentication for your entire organization 
* Submit a test support ticket

## Manage your brand by customizing CIS pages
CIS has to occasionally show content to your end-users. This can include security challenge pages, block pages, and error pages. All of this content can be customized by you to ensure a consistent branding experience for your customers.

There are two ways to customize CIS pages:

1. **Domain-Wide:** Within the settings of each domain, you can go to the **Customize** application to change the default pages for each and every page we could potentially show your users.

2. **Organization-Wide:** If you have many domains within your CIS account and would like to create Custom pages for all of them, you can do so within your **Organization** settings.

## Enforce 2-factor authentication across your entire organization
CIS allows you to enforce 2-Factor Authentication. This extra element of security can prevent unauthorized access of your CIS console.

1. First, go to the upper right hand corner and select your **Organization Settings**. 
2. From the main Organization Page, youâ€™ll see Enforce 2-Factor Authentication. Select it to engage the new level of security.

## Submit a test ticket with our support team
Feel free to write a quick note to our support team to test our support workflow. 

There are two easy ways to submit a ticket.

1. Email entsupport@CIS.com.
